# Props & State
Use props for presentable data and State for stateful persistence 

# state & useState
state can used in Class or use hook useState
note the difference, in state only specific attribute is changed,
whereas in useState whole object(lets/const) is replaced.
so it's recommended useState should be a single entity (keep as minimum attribute as possible)
